    "title": "Our Motivation",
    "body": "Among many of our friends, the demand for a free solution to create attractive eBay auction templates without manual effort increased at the beginning of 2020. So Joyce and I decided to take the project into our own hands and put it into action while studying for our bachelor's degree in computer science. In the meantime, Auction Template has developed into the third iteration of a project close to our hearts. The goal is and remains the free and automated provision of modern auction templates to your eBay listings. We hope to increase the attractiveness of your listings through a consistent and professional appearance and are already working on further features."
